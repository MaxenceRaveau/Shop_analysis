# PythonForDataAnalysis_FinalProject
In this repository, you'll find the results of our final project for the course "Python for Data Analysis". This project has been made by Gaëlle RIGAUD and Maxence RAVEAU.

The objectives of this project was to visualize the data and create supervized learning models on a given dataset. Our data set is called "online_shoppers_intentions" and represent consultations of a online shopping website by customers. In machine learning models, the aim is to predict if a consultation will end by a sale or not. 

In the report, you'll see that we found that the number of pages consulted by a customer is the variable that explain the most is there is a sale or not. Besides, all the machine learning models we created are relevant for our dataset, but the best still is Logistic Regression.
