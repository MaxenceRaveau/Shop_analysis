# PythonForDataAnalysis_FinalProject
In this repository, you'll find the results of our final project for the course "Python for Data Analysis". This project has been made by Maxence RAVEAU and GaÃ«lle Rigaud .

The objectives of this project was to visualize the data and create supervized learning models on a given dataset. Our data set is called "online_shoppers_intentions" and represent consultations of a online shopping website by customers. In machine learning models, the aim is to predict if a consultation will end by a sale or not. 

In the report, you'll see that we found that the number of pages consulted by a customer is the variable that explain the most is there is a sale or not. Besides, all the machine learning models we created are relevant for our dataset, but the best still is Logistic Regression.
